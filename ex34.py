#Accessing elements of lists

#lists are pretty useful, but unless you can get at the things in them
#they are not all that good.  you can already go through the elements of a
#list in order, but what if you want the 5th element
#the first element of a list begins with zero
#the order of animals is important.  you cannot have a second animal without
#the first.  we call these kinds of numbers ordinal numbers because they
#indicate an ordering of things

#the need to pull elements out at random means that they need a way to indicate
#elements consistently by address  or an 'index'
#the best way to indicate indices by address is to start indices at zero
#ordinal == ordered
#cardinal == cards at random, indices at zero

animals = ['bear', 'python3.6', 'peacock', 'kangaroo', 'whale', 'platypus']
